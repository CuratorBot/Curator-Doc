# Getting Started with Curator

## Quick Start Guide

Before everything else, take note that Curator has now fully transitioned to **`Slash Commands.`** So please make sure that your server members has access to use **`Slash Commands.`**

**Curator can be setup in 5 simple steps:**

1. Invite Curator with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=816152179101663312\&scope=applications.commands+bot\&permissions=288482360) if you haven't yet.
2. Once Curator is your server, type \*\*`/setup normal` \*\* in a channel Curator can see.
   * Curator currently has 2 VC functions:
     1. **`/setup normal`** - Creates a standard Category and Voice Channel. More Info
     2. **`/setup clone`** - Creates a cloned version of Category and Voice Channel. More Info
3. Curator would then create a new Category named **`Custom Voice Channels`** with a Voice Channel named **`ðŸ”Šï½œJoin to create!`** inside.
4. You can now choose to rename the newly created Category and drag it to your intended position. You also drag the Voice Channel to an already existing Category, you can now delete the **`Custom Voice Channels`** Category as it is now empty.
5. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your new Custom Voice Channels!
