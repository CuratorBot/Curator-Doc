# Initial Setup

Curator can easily be setup by doing these simple steps:

1. Ensure that to bot is in your server, click [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=816152179101663312\&scope=applications.commands+bot\&permissions=288482360) if it isn't.
2. Once Curator is your server, type **`/setup normal`** in a channel Curator can see.
   * Curator currently has 2 VC functions:
     1. **`/setup normal`** - Creates a standard Category and Voice Channel. [More Info](normal-vcs.md)
     2. **`/setup clone`** - Creates a cloned version of Category and Voice Channel. [More Info](cloned-vcs.md)
3. Curator would then create a new Category named **`Custom Voice Channels`** with a Voice Channel named **`ðŸ”Šï½œJoin to create!`** inside.
4. You can now choose to rename the newly created Category and drag it to your intended position. You also drag the Voice Channel to an already existing Category, you can now delete the **`Custom Voice Channels`** Category as it is now empty.

And you're done, Curator is now fully setup!
