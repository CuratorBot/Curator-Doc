# Normal VCs

## Overview

Normal VCs is your basic Custom VC creation that can be customized by the channel owner without restrictions.

### Behavior

Normal VC's behavior is simple, Users join the **`ðŸ”Šï½œJoin to Create`** VC and Curator in turn creates a Voice Channel and Text Channel for the Channel Owner. The Channel Owner can then customize their own Voice and Text Channel to their liking.

### Creation

Creating a Normal VC is simple, simply type **`/setup normal`** and Curator would create a Category named **`Custom Voice Channels`** and a Voice Channel named **`ðŸ”Šï½œJoin to Create`** inside.
